The methodology for the project can be broken down into the following steps:

Identification of independent parameters and subcriteria: The independent parameters for the project are Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI), Land Use Land Cover (LULC), Connectivity, Substations, Temperature, Cloud Cover, and Humanity. These parameters are further divided into subcriteria such as terrain slope, land cover type, distance from substations, etc.

Resampling of data: Since the data for different parameters is collected at different spatial resolutions, it is important to resample the data to bring it to a common spatial resolution. This is done to ensure that all data layers can be analyzed together and compared accurately.

Generation of classified layers: The data for each subcriteria is classified and converted into a raster layer. For example, the LULC data can be classified into different land cover types such as agricultural land, forest, urban areas, etc.

Weighted overlay: A weighted overlay analysis is performed to combine the classified layers and assign weights to each layer based on their relative importance in determining the suitability of an area for solar farms. The weighted overlay analysis combines the different layers and generates a composite score for each pixel in the study area.

AHP Technique for Weighted Overlay: The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) technique is used to assign weights to the subcriteria. This technique involves pairwise comparisons of the subcriteria to determine their relative importance.

Classified land suitability map: Based on the composite scores generated through the weighted overlay analysis, the study area is classified into different classes of suitability for solar farms. These classes can range from highly suitable to not suitable for solar farms.
